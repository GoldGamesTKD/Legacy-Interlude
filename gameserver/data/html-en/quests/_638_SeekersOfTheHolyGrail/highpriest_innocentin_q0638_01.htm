High Priest Innocentin:

Recent activities at the *Pagan Temple* have raised my concerns. Considering the shenanigans that normally go on there, you must surely understand the peril!

You see, they've set their sights on Saint Solina's *Grail of Splendor* ! I'm sure that if we don't stop them, something terrible and irrevocable will happen! Will you help us in our time of need?
