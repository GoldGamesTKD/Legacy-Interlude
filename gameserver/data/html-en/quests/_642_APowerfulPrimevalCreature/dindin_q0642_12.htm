<body>Dinn:<br>Thank you! <br>You must defeat the <font color="LEVEL">Velociraptor, Pterosaur, Ornithomimus and Deinonychus</font> dinosaurs and bring back samples of their biological tissue.<br>For
your information, 1 <font color="LEVEL">Ancient Egg</font> and 150 dinosaur biological tissues can be processed as one set of samples.<br>You will be able to find the egg while combing through the
dinosaurs' habitat. But be very careful! When the egg is disturbed, <font color="LEVEL">the nearby dinosaurs will come running to protect it. We do not require as many eggs as dinosaur biological
    tissue, so assess the situation carefully and do what you think is best.</font><br>Keep up the good work!
