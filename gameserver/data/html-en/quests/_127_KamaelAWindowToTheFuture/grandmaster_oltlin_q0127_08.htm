Grand Master Oltlin:

If it concerns the Kamael race, he would have told you well enough for you to understand. Were you to ask me a hundred times, I would tell you nothing more.

Perhaps it would be more profitable for you to either find the next collaborator in the chain or return to the man who gave you this task. Wouldn't you agree?
