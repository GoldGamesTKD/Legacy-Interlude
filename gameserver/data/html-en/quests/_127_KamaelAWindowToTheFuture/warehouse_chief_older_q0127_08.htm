Warehouse Chief Alder:

Please take the Mark of Future that I gave you to *High Prefect Aklan in the Town of Goddard.* Aklan is the Orc collaborator, so he will be able to tell you about the Orcs' perspective on the situation.

You know that the Town of Goddard is located at the center of the Goddard region, right? Then please be on your way. And be discreet. If someone finds you suspicious, he may try to follow you.
