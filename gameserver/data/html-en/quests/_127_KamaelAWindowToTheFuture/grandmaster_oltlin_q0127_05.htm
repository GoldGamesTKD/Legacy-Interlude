Grand Master Oltlin:

Those soft, meek, tree-loving Elves hate us and fear that we will learn how to harness the power of the Kamael for ourselves. And in fact, the Kamael's physical strength and prowess in battle are similar to that of the Dark Elves...and Orcs.

I have even heard that the Orcs have already opened talks with the new race! We too wish an opportunity to meet with the Kamael, but the controlling Elves will not allow such a thing to happen without their incessant meddling.

But hear me: Dark Elves and Kamael must be allowed to interact freely. Do you understand?
