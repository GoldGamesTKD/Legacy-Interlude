Klaus Blackbird:

Excellent! Your decision warms my heart. Take this mark, which is called the *Mark of Future*. Take it to *Warehouse Chief Alder in the Town of Schuttgart* and he will give you his report, as well as the mark you will require to obtain the next collaborator's report. When you have collected a report from each collaborator, deliver the information to Dominic.

By the way, the quickest way to reach Alder in Schuttgart is to pass through Rune Township. May Gran Kain smile on your journey!
