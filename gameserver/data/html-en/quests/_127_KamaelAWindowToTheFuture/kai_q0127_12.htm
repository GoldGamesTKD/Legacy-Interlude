Klaus Blackburg:

As you may already know, the codename for this plan is *"The Name that Opens the Future."* This certificate I am giving you is the *"Certificate of the Future."*  First, give it to *Head Warehouse Keeper Older in Schuttgart Castle Village.* When you do so, he will give you the next necessary information and certificate. Then do the same with the other collaborators, ultimately delivering everything to Dominique. Then you will have completed your mission.

You will find Older in Schuttgart Castle Village, in the Schuttgart Territory. The quickest route there is through Rune Island Village. May the gods protect you on your journey!
