<html><head><body>Guard Alvah: <BR>So sad. Those heroic patrolmen gave their lives for this 
information... <BR>Let's see... What's this? Ol Mahums allied with Dwarves...?! 
What treachery!<BR>This is treason! We must tread carefully, my friend. The 
influence of the Dwarven Guild cannot be ignored. If we rushed in and made such 
charges that were later proven untrue, we would be in serious trouble.<BR>We 
need proof of this conspiracy of Dwarves and Ol Mahums! Go to the 
<font color="LEVEL">Abandoned Camp</font> and check out the <font color="LEVEL">ol mahum 
generals</font>. That should yield some proof. </BODY></HTML>
