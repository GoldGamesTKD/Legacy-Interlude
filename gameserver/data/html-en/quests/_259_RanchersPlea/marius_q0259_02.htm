But... something happened and I pledged not to touch a sword again. I am retired now.<br>I felt terrible that I haven't been able to help Edmond. Thankfully, I owe you gratitude for volunteering to kill these spiders for us.<br>Tell me if you need anything. I will exchange <font color="LEVEL">two Healing Potions, 250 Wooden Arrows, 60 no grade soulshots or 30 no grade spiritshots</font> for <font color="LEVEL">ten Giant Spider Skins</font>.<br><a action="bypass -h Quest _259_RanchersPlea reply_1">Say you will not make an exchange.</a><br><a action="bypass -h Quest _259_RanchersPlea reply_2">Say you will make an exchange for two high-quality Healing Potions.</a><br><a action="bypass -h Quest _259_RanchersPlea reply_3">Say you will make an exchange for 250 Wooden Arrows.</a><br><a action="bypass -h Quest _259_RanchersPlea reply_5">Say you will make an exchange for 60 no grade soulshots.</a><br><a action="bypass -h Quest _259_RanchersPlea reply_6">Say you will make an exchange for 30 no grade spiritshots.</a></body></html>
